A patient story is an individual's personal account of their healthcare experience as described in 
their own words. At its simplest, it is a conversation with a patient or someone close to them, such 
as a relative or carer, which is recorded and transcribed. 

Patient stories can be used to emphasize why quality improvement initiatives are important, and to 
help discuss the difficult decisions, personal circumstances, and values that patients bring to health 
care. 

Other Reason: Etymology. The word patient originally meant 'one who suffers'. This English noun 
comes from the Latin word patiens, the present participle of the deponent verb, patior, meaning 'I am 
suffering,' and akin to the Greek verb πάσχειν (= paskhein, to suffer) and its cognate noun πάθος (= 
pathos). 

Ensuring patient safety is a national priority, and everyone involved in the healthcare system has a 
role, including the patient. Patients can help make their healthcare experience safer by becoming 
active, involved, and informed members of the healthcare team.
